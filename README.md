## 💡 The Problem
We consume hours of video content (lectures, tutorials, meetings), but our brains struggle to retain linear information. We forget how concepts connect.

## 🚀 The Solution
**VidGraph.ai** is an AI-powered visualization tool that transforms YouTube transcripts into **Interactive Knowledge Graphs**.
Instead of reading a wall of text, you explore a dynamic network of concepts, seeing exactly how ideas relate to one another.

## ✨ Key Features
- **AI Concept Extraction:** Uses **Google Gemini Pro** to identify core concepts and relationships.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Drag, zoom, and explore nodes using a physics-based graph engine.
- **Hybrid Input System:** Supports both direct YouTube URL fetching and manual transcript processing for maximum reliability.
- **Dark Mode UI:** A clean, developer-focused interface built with Streamlit.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini (1.5 Flash/Pro)
- **Visualization:** PyVis (Network Graph)
- **Backend Logic:** Python
